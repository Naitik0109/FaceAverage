Face Averaging Project

This project uses OpenCV and NumPy to create an "average face" by aligning and blending multiple face images. It consists of two main files: a Python script for preprocessing images and landmarks (faceAverage.py), and a C++ program (faceAverage.cpp) for additional processing.

Features

Image Alignment: Aligns face images based on key facial landmarks to ensure uniformity.
Face Averaging: Blends multiple aligned face images to produce an average face.
